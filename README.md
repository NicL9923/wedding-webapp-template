-Pictures of, details about, and directions to the wedding ceremony and venue  
-Countdown to the wedding, wedding party pyramid, about the bride/groom, travel details  
-Registry page with links to store registries  
-Song Requests  
-Admin and DJ pages to manage RSVPs and Song Requests  
-Automatic report generation for RSVP info (Admin feature)  
-Mobile responsiveness
